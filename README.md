Implementation of selected numerical methods:

- Assignment 1 - determining the zero point by bisection and determining the minimum of the function by the golden ratio method.
- Assignment 2 - solving N linear equations with N unknowns by the Gauss-Jordan elimination method.
- Assignment 3 - interpolation by Newton's method on Chebyshev nodes.
- Assignment 4 - numerical integration by Newton-Cotes and Gauss methods.
- Assignment 5 - polynomial approximation on Legendre nodes.

General implementation requirements:
- To calculate the values ​​of polynomials, programs use the Horner scheme.
- Programs do not use the pow() function to raise the base to an integer power, similarly they do not use the goto, break and continue instructions.
- Programs do not use recursive algorithms, only iterative ones.
- The created program should be divided into many source files, no program duplicates the same function several times unnecessarily. (From the second task, the code was written in Jupiter, whose individual code cells can be read as separate files.)

Detailed requirements for specific assignments are described in README files in individual folders.
