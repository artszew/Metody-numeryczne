<b> Assignment 1 </b>
Implementation of two numerical methods:
- determining the zero using the bisection method (Stop or precision condition).
- determining the minimum of the function on the unimodal interval using the golden ratio method.

Guidelines for functionality:
- The program has several different nonlinear functions built in: polynomial, trigonometric, exponential and their compositions.
- The user selects one of the functions, specifies the interval on which the zero is sought and selects the criterion for stopping the algorithm.
- The program performs calculations using both methods, displays the results and draws a graph of the selected function on the given interval, marking the solutions on the graph.
- For the golden ratio method, the program checks the unimodality of the given interval.
