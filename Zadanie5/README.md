Implementation of numerical approximation on Legendre nodes.

Guidelines for functionality:
- [x] The program offers several functions to choose from: linear, modulus, polynomial, trigonometric and their composition.
- [x] Horner's scheme was used to calculate the values ​​of polynomials.
- [x] The user selects the function to be approximated, the approximation interval, the degree of the approximating polynomial and parameters related to the integration method such as the number of nodes.
- [x] The program determines the approximation polynomial of the specified degree, draws its graph (together with the graph of the original function) and calculates the approximation error.
- [x] The program has a mode of operation in which the user specifies the expected approximation error and the program iteratively selects the degree of the approximating polynomial
starting from degree 1.
