<b> Assignment 2</b>

Implementation of numerical solution of systems of N linear equations with N unknowns using the Gauss-Jordan elimination method.

Guidelines for functionality:
- The maximum number of equations may be limited in advance, but the constructed algorithm should be universal, and the user should be able to select the number of equations during program operation.
- It should be possible to conveniently enter coefficients of the system of equations by reading them from a file.
- The program must automatically select the basic element and detect situations when the system is inconsistent or indeterminate.
- The report should include information on how the program behaves in the case of inconsistent and indeterminate systems.
