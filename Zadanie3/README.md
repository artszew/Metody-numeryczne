Implementation of Newton's interpolation method on Chebyshev nodes.

Guidelines for functionality:
- The program allows you to select one of several functions:
a) linear,
b) |x|,
c) polynomial,
d) trigonometric,
e) their composition.
- The values ​​of interpolated polynomials should be calculated using Horner's scheme.
- The values ​​of interpolation polynomials should be calculated directly, because using Horner's scheme is not possible without first transforming the interpolation polynomial to the canonical form.
- The user selects: function, number of interpolation nodes, interpolation interval.
- The position of nodes is calculated from appropriate formulas,
- The values ​​in interpolation nodes are calculated using a function selected by the user.
- The program should draw a graph of the original function and interpolation polynomial and mark interpolation nodes
- Sample graphs should be included in the report.
- Investigate how changing the number of nodes affects the accuracy of interpolation.
- How many nodes are needed to interpolate an N-degree polynomial
